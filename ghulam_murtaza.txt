My name is Ghulam Murtaza. I am an eResearch Analyst with Intersect. I am currently based at Australian Catholic University Melbourne Campus. I work with researchers from ACU to realise their ICT related requirements and help ACU in building their IT strategy for research. Part of my job is also training researchers at ACU.
